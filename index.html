         <hr>
         <ul>
           <p><Strong>Personal skillsand competences:</Strong></p>
           <li>I gained numerous awards in recognition of my work, including the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London in 1925, and the Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1935.</li>

           <p><Strong>Communication skills:</strong></p>

            <li>In 1901 I acquired Swiss citizenship.</li>
            <li>In 1914 I became a German citizen and remained in Berlin until 1933 when I renounced my citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America.</li>
            <li>In 1940 I became a United States citizen.</li>

           <p><strong>Organisational / managerial skills.</strong></p>

            <li>During the 1920's I lectured in Europe, America and the Far East and I was awarded Fellowships or Memberships of all the leading scientific academies throughout the world.</li>
           <p><Strong>Technical skills and competences:</Strong></p>
            <article><li>At the start of my scientific work, I realized the inadequacies of Newtonian mechanics and my special theory of relativity stemmed from an attempt to reconcile the laws of mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. I dealt with classical problems of statistical mechanics and problems in which they were merged with quantum theory: this led to an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules. I investigated the thermal properties of light with a low radiation density and my observations laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.
In my early days in Berlin, I postulated that the correct interpretation of the special theory of relativity must also furnish a theory of gravitation and in 1916 I published my paper on the general theory of relativity. During this time I also contributed to the problems of the theory of radiation and statistical mechanics.
In the 1920's, I embarked on the construction of unified field theories, although I continued to work on the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory, and I persevered with this work in America. I contributed to statistical mechanics by my development of the quantum theory of a monatomic gas and I have also accomplished valuable work in connection with atomic transition probabilities and relativistic cosmology.
After my retirement I continued to work towards the unification of the basic concepts of physics, taking the opposite approach, geometrization, to the majority of physicists.

<p><Strong>Artistic skills and competences:</strong></p>
 <li>Music played an important part in my life. I married Mileva Maric in 1903 and we had a daughter and two sons; the marriage was dissolved in 1919 and in the same yearI married my cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, who died in 1936.</li>
<p><Strong>Other skills and competences:</Strong></p>
 <li>In 1916 I published my paper on the general theory of relativity. </li>
 <li>My more important works include Special Theory of Relativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), General Theory of Relativity (1916), Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), and The Evolution of Physics (1938). Among my non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most important.</li>
